## Description:

1.  this plot defies the rule of thinking of the parameters before you plot and what you need to plot.
2.  the colour scheme of the plot should be able to distinguish enough between the various points of the data which is missing in this plot.
3.  the axis labels in a plot should be depicted in a clear way so that the reader understands the values which is hidden/not shown in this plot.
4.  another important aspect of depicting a plot is thinking which geom would be appropriate for the data which in this case is point and does not solve the purpose for the data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

glimpse(mpg)

p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = fl, group = cyl)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=cyl), color = "grey") 

+
  scale_fill_gradient(low="white", high="white")
  
  
print(p1)


p1 +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_blank())

```
